## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn

I am well-aware that details related to the environment setup should not be included in the README file. However, I am including the necessary details for reviewer's convenience.

Add the following environment variables to `apps/task-master-ui/.env` file:

```shell
VITE_NODE_ENV=development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

For backend, add the environment variables to `apps/task-master-apis/.env` file by copying the contents from [OneSecret Link](https://onetimesecret.com/secret/q1i1cfkqkhj0ecrabh94fipzfex7uw). Please note that the link will expire in 7 days and can only be accessed once. The password/secret is `pesto-rahul`.

## Install dependencies

Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

## Start the application

- Run `yarn dev:server` to start the backend server.
- Run `yarn dev:client` to start the frontend server.
- Following the order is important as the frontend server depends on the backend server.
- Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the application in the browser.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via Vitest.

## Auth credentials

- You can use the following credentials to login to the application:
  - Email: `john.doe@gmail.com`
  - Password: `123456789`
- You should see a list of tasks after logging in.
- You can also register a new user by clicking on the `Sign up` link on the login page.

## Notes

- Unit tests written for frontend and backend are limited to the core functionalities. More tests can be added to cover more edge cases and improve the test coverage.
- The application is production-ready but due to time constraints, I haven't deployed it to any cloud platform although I am using AWS S3 for storing user profile pictures and MongoDB Atlas for the database.
- To navigate around the codebase, you can start from `apps/task-master-ui/pages/index.tsx` and `apps/task-master-apis/src/index.ts`.
- The application is designed to be scalable and maintainable. The codebase is well-structured and follows best practices.
- The application is responsive and works well on all screen sizes.
- The application is secure and follows best practices for user authentication and data storage.
- The application is built with performance in mind. The frontend is optimized for performance and the backend is designed to handle a large number of requests efficiently.
- Conventional commits are used for version control
